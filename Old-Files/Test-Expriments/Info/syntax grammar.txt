# Variables
mvar a = 10;
mvar b = 20;

# Arithmetic operations
Add a to b;        # adds b to a
Sub a to b;        # subtracts b from a
Multiply a to b;        # multiplies a by b
Divide a to b;        # divides a by b

# Booleans
mvar hi = false;

mvar hello = true;

# Arrays
mvar array = ["hi", "bruh", "e"];

# Array operations
array.show_all();       # shows all items in the array
array.show_at(2);       # shows the item at index 2
array.remove_at(3);     # removes the item at index 3
array.insert("hello", at: 4);   # inserts "hello" at index 4

# File operations
mvar file_location = "C:\Users\ssaya\OneDrive\Desktop\Miico\new_file.txt";

mvar new_file = Create.File((name)'txt');   # creates a txt file
mvar new_file_2 = Create.File((name)'my');  # creates another my script

new_file.write("hello");  # writes "hello" into the created file
new_file.read();  # reads all content of the file

# Folder operations
mvar new_folder = Create.Folder((name));  # creates a folder
mvar old_folder = "C:\Users\ssaya\OneDrive\Desktop\Miico\new_file.txt";

new_folder.create_file((name)'txt');  # creates a txt file in the folder
new_folder.read();  # reads all contents in the folder
new_folder.move(new_file, to: old_folder);  # moves files in mii

# User Input
mfunc user_input():
    text = AskInput("");  # asks for input and saves it in a text variable
    mprint(text);

    my_name = AskInput();  # stores text in a custom variable
    mprint(my_name);

    multiple_inputs = AskInput(run for 2);  # asks for input twice and stores it in text
    mprint(multiple_inputs);

    both = AskInput(my_name add my_age as both);  # asks for variables and combines them as both
    mprint(both);

# Control Flow
if;
elif;
else;
and;

# Define a function
mfunc add_numbers(x, y):
    result = x add y;
    mprint(result);

# Use the function
mrun add_numbers(run for 2);  # runs the function 2 times

# Print a message
mprint("Hello, World!");
